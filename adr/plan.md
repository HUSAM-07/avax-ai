## 1. Value Proposition & Scope

**What you’ll build:**
A web app that connects to a user’s wallet (on Avalanche C‑Chain or other EVM chains) or monitors one or more DeFi positions, fetches on-chain & market data, uses the OpenAI API (or similar) to generate insights such as:

* “Your current LP/staking position has high impermanent loss risk because the pool’s volume dropped 60% in last 24h.”
* “You hold 70% of your portfolio in volatile tokens vs stable/hedged assets — consider rebalancing.”
* “Sentiment around Token X is negative (gas/volume/liquidity down) and your position is increasingly exposed — suggestion: reduce exposure or set a stop‐loss.”
* Dashboard view of portfolio health, risk metrics, and “what if” scenarios generated by AI (e.g., “if you reallocate 30% to stablecoins you may reduce risk by X%”).

**Why this is valuable:**

* Many DeFi users have positions but lack tools that translate raw on‐chain numbers into *actionable insights*.
* Using LLMs + blockchain data gives a layer of human-friendly interpretation.
* Target user (trader / portfolio manager / DeFi enthusiast) will appreciate “insights I understand” rather than raw TVL graphs.
* On Avalanche and other chains you can stand out (less tooling than e.g. Ethereum).
* Potential for subscription/monetisation once you show value.

**MVP scope (keep it simple):**

* Support only 1 chain (Avalanche C-Chain).
* Support only wallet connection + fetch positions (no DAO/governance heavy stuff yet).
* Provide 2-3 insight types (risk exposure, rebalancing suggestion, sentiment alert).
* Dashboard + simple UX.
* Use testnet / free tier data/APIs early; production later.

## 2. Tech Stack

Here’s a recommended stack:

### Frontend

* React (or Next.js) with TypeScript
* UI library: TailwindCSS (for rapid styling)
* Web3 wallet connection: e.g. MetaMask / WalletConnect (supports Avalanche C-Chain)
* Charting library for dashboard (e.g., Recharts or Chart.js)

### Backend

* Node.js (Express) or Python (FastAPI) — pick whichever you prefer
* Server will handle: connecting to wallet data APIs, fetching on -chain data, calling OpenAI API, preparing insight responses
* Could also be serverless functions (e.g., Vercel / AWS Lambda) for cost efficiency.

### Database / Storage

* Relational DB (PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) depending on preference — store user profiles, wallet addresses, fetched snapshots, etc.
* Possibly time‐series DB (or just table) for storing historical snapshots if you want to track over time.

### Blockchain & Data Layer

* RPC provider for Avalanche C-Chain for on-chain data (could use Infura/Alchemy if they support Avalanche, or public RPC)
* Use third-party APIs for richer portfolio / DeFi data (see section 3)
* Use market data APIs (price, volume, sentiment)
* Use oracle/feeds when needed (for advanced usage)

### AI / LLM Layer

* OpenAI API (Chat Completions endpoint) to generate insight text, summarization, etc.
* Possibly fine‐tune or prompt‐engineer for DeFi context.
* Monitor token usage/costs.

### Hosting / Infrastructure

* Hosting: Vercel (frontend) + Supabase/Firebase (optional) or AWS/GCP for backend.
* Authentication: Auth0 or Firebase Auth (if you want user login) or simply wallet-based authentication (sign a message).
* CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions).
* Monitoring: Logging of API usage and errors.

## 3. API Requirements & Sign-Ups

Here are the APIs you’ll need, plus how to sign up and use:

### A. OpenAI API

* Sign up at [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/)
* Get an API key. Ensure you review pricing, quotas, rate limits.
* Documentation: Chat Completions, models (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-3.5-turbo` depending on budget)
* Use good prompt engineering. Monitor token usage/costs.
* For compliance/usage management, refer to OpenAI enterprise features (security, monitoring) if you scale. ([OpenAI][1])
* Stored usage and cost logs advised.

### B. On-Chain / DeFi Data APIs

You’ll want wallet portfolio / DeFi positions + market data.

* Zerion API: covers Avalanche multi-chain wallet portfolio, positions, PnL, etc. ([Zerion][2])

  * Sign-up: visit their site, get API key, choose plan.
  * Use endpoint: `/wallets/{address}/positions`, `/wallets/{address}/portfolio`.
* DeFi Llama API: free/open-source metrics for DeFi protocols on Avalanche (TVL, yield, etc) ([Avalanche Builder Hub][3])

  * Good for protocol-level data.
* CoinGecko API: token prices, historical data for Avalanche tokens. ([CoinGecko][4])

  * Good for price changes, volume, sentiment proxies.
* Dune Analytics: for deeper historical data, dashboards and API (with query). ([Dune][5])
* Pyth Network or DIA for oracle data (if needed). ([Avalanche Builder Hub][6])
* Avalanche Data/Metric APIs: e.g., Metrics API for chain data. ([Avalanche Support][7])

### C. Wallet / Authentication

* Web3 wallet connection: MetaMask (free)
* For backend you might need user to sign message to prove control of wallet (no extra API sign-up needed).
* If you support many users and subscription, you might integrate payment API (Stripe, etc).

### D. Optional: Sentiment / News Data

* You might want crypto news/sentiment API (e.g., Santiment, LunarCrush, IntoTheBlock) for deeper insights (optional MVP).
* Sign-up their free tier as required.

## 4. Architecture & Data Flow

Here’s how your MVP system might work end-to-end:

1. **User Onboards**

   * User connects their wallet (MetaMask) on Avalanche C-Chain.
   * Optionally sign a message to authenticate.

2. **Data Fetching**

   * Backend receives wallet address.
   * It calls Zerion API to get current portfolio + positions (LP tokens, staking, yields).
   * It calls CoinGecko (or similar) to fetch current prices, volume, market data for tokens in the portfolio.
   * It may call DeFi Llama / Dune to get protocol metrics, e.g., TVL change, yield change, risk metrics.
   * Store snapshot of data (positions + market) in DB for tracking over time.

3. **Data Processing & Insight Generation**

   * Compute internal metrics: e.g., portfolio diversification, exposure to high volatility tokens, yield vs risk, LP fee income vs impermanent loss proxies, trending direction of protocols.
   * Build prompt for OpenAI: e.g.,

     ```
     You are a DeFi portfolio analyst. The user holds 3 assets: Token A 50%, Token B 30%, Token C 20%. Token A dropped 40% in last 24h, yield farming in LP on Pool X has fee income down 60% while TVL increased 30%. Provide a short natural-language insight: risk exposure, rebalancing suggestion, highlight any urgent issues.
     ```
   * Send to OpenAI Chat-Completion API, receive an insight text.

4. **Dashboard/UX**

   * Display user dashboard: portfolio summary, key metrics (e.g., “Diversified? Yes/No”, “Yield vs benchmark”, “Top risk asset”).
   * Show “AI Insight” panel: the text insight from OpenAI.
   * Optionally show “What-if” widget: user can adjust hypothetical allocation and backend recomputes metrics + generate alternate insight.

5. **Alerts / Notifications**

   * Optionally send email/push notifications if a triggered event (e.g., token exposure > X%, protocol yield drop > Y%).
   * Could use Webhooks, or schedule periodic checks.

6. **Monitoring & Logging**

   * Log API usage (OpenAI tokens, Zerion calls) for cost control.
   * Track errors, latency, user feedback.

## 6. Key Technical Considerations & Risks

* **Prompt Engineering & Cost**: Each insight call to OpenAI costs tokens + latency. Need to optimise prompts and possibly limit calls per user.
* **Data freshness**: On DeFi you want near-real-time or at least hourly data for meaningful insights. Choose API sources accordingly.
* **Security & Privacy**: Users are linking wallets; treat data sensitively. Don’t store private keys. Use wallet-signature for auth only.
* **Scalability**: If many users, API call costs + data fetching load could become heavy. Might need caching.
* **Interpretability & Accuracy**: AI insights are suggestions — need disclaimers (“not financial advice”) and guardrails (don’t mislead).
* **Edge Cases**: Protocols with weird tokenomics, LP tokens in illiquid pools, new chains etc. You’ll need to detect data gaps.
* **Compliance**: If you add subscriptions or move into financial advice territory, legal/regulatory aspects may matter.
